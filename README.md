# Continuity Theory: Seismic Analysis

This repository contains the full Python code used in Section 10 of the paper:  
**"Continuity Theory: Memory, Distortion, and the Recursive Construction of Reality"**

## Files Included

- `ContinuityTheory_SeismicAnalysis_2010_2015.py`
- `ContinuityTheory_SeismicAnalysis_2015_2020.py`

## Purpose

These scripts reproduce the complete analysis, plots, and statistical modeling used to validate the Continuity Theory framework in the context of real earthquake data from California (2010–2020).

The logic reflects the symbolic structure of the theory, including memory projection, distortion, rupture (Θ), and recursive realignment.
